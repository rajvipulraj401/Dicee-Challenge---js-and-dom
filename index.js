    step 3 - in who we want to change we have made the name of images as
    step 4 - dice1.png , dice2.png so we JUST NEED TO PUT THE LOCATION OF
     STEP 5 - FOLDER  AND THEn concatenate the variable name randomNumber1 where we have stored the
      value of all the random numbers we are getting and then at last concatenate and add the extension of .png files in
       that way we would be able to add different source images .

   whether the oringinal src is being pointed at or not .

   document.querySelector("img").getAttribute("src");

  step 2- then use setAttribute to point it to different location .
